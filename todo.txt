Server side

    –– races are being saved but user id is null (fetch races would not work)
    –– disallow saving the same races (validate by race date)
    –– verification email route should return some data on success
       (e.g., email destination, verificationLink)
       it should simplify testing
    –– cookie doesn't work without binding response manually
    –– reset password logic (db and route)
    –– endpoint for all stats
    –– database migration (manual or automatic)


    Integration tests:
    –– registration (through email somehow)
    ―― adding and fetching races
    ―― reset password logic through email

Mobile app
     ―― create native android app for tracking only (remove running/walking tracking from web completely)
     ―― add current speed
     –– make sure "no internet connection" doesn't break the app

Client side

    –– no interaction if user is not logged in
    ―― registration page
    ―― login page
    ―― email verification page
    ―― reset password page 
    ―― calculate zoom programmaticaly (it is 12 for now)
    ―― rerender map zoom and values on partial values change
    ―― add possibility to cut the race (when viewing the google map path) using mouse
    ―― different units for partial race values
    ―― overall statistics for all races 
        do not download all races at once, but only stuff that is important
        for example, if average run speed is needed, get it from backend directly
    –– download only one race on google map path page (not all races at once)

    ―― Integration or e2e tests
    ―― Rethink connectors testing 
        Unit tests are kinda useless.
        Mb it's better to use integration tests instead
Misc
    –– remove MESSAGES from core app completely
    ―― find out how to get heroku domain value (in order to pass it to reset password email, etc.)
    ―― database backup using cloud storage (email on failed backup)
